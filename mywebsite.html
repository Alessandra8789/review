<p> 
I am 22 years old, I grew up in an international house hold. My dad is cuban my mom is Russian. I am a world traveler and love Volenetaring, below you will find a list of places where I lived and where I volunteered. Growing up I played professional tennis, but unfortunately at the age of 17 my career ended due to an injury. One of my favorite hobbies is art, I love making short films, drawing paintings and editing films. This is why I chose to study Media and Culture in College with and interactive track.<br><b style=color:red> 
This is where coding comes into Play.</b></br>

When taking a New Media course  our professor told us about the women's coding program, which we had at our university. It was a self taught program once a week. I went to check it out, because I love creating things and I realized that this could be another platform where my imagination could flourish. I was right. I fell in love with coding during the second week of the program.
